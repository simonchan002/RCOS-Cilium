Interested in learning some object oriented programming, networking (TCP/IP protocols), and interfacing with Linux. Over the past few classes, I learned about kubernetes and took notes on that. I was also reading up on the documentation so that I know how the process works and understanding terraform. Also was in the process of installing minikube, but was running into issues with docker. Next week, I plan to finish learning about the project and finally install minikube.
