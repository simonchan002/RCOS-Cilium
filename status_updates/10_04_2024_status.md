This week I was able to finish installing minikube and fixed the docker issues I was having related to it. Went through the terraform documentation and was able to install it. Figured out the various different commands of terraform such as terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply. Also familiarized myself with the terraform workspace. Also started installing the Cilium CLI and kubectl. 
Spin up and initialize using the terraform workspace. Finish installing the Cillium CLI and kubectl and run some of the commands to verify a successful installation. Also next week, I plan to spinup a cluster using the Cilium terraform workspace.




Notes on kubernetes that I took and the solution to the errors I had using Docker

What is Kubernetes?
Manages applications that contain container
Works for managing deployment environments (vm, cloud, physical)
High availability (low downtime), scalable, data backup
Need for container orchestration tool
Containers have increased usage
Main Kubernetes components
Node: server (virtual or physical)
Pod: creates running environment on top of container (typically runs 1 application container). Each pod gets an IP and uses IP to communicate. If server runs out of resources, pod will die and a new one will be reinstated.
Service: Static IP address attached to each pod, this is how pods communicate
External service to allow access the application/browser
Request goes from Ingress (https, not ip)  -> Service (IP)
Load Balancer: Forwards request to pods that are less busy
Config Map 
Configuration data (external) , donâ€™t need to build a new image
Secret 
Similar to config map, but is secure for storing passwords
Environmental variables: Allows for use the data from config map
Volumes: persistent storage (external hard drive); USERS have to back up.
Deployment: Define a blueprint of a pod and how many pods to replicate. 
Databases should be hosted outside of the K8 cluster
Kubernetes Architecture
Master/Slave config
Kubelet - interfaces the container runtime and the node. Taking the config and running the pod and the container inside 
Kube Proxy: forwards the requests to different pods. 
Node Process needs 3:
Kubelet
Kube Proxy
Container Runtime
Master nodes:
API server (request <-> cluster)
Scheduler: Start the application pod, also determines which new node the pod  should be executed in
Controller manager: pods die, reschedule pods and recovers the original cluster state
Etcd: Brain of cluster, IMAGE. Changes get stored here. Holds data on cluster state.


		
Restart Docker
