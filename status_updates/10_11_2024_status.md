This week, finished installing kubectl and Cilium CLI. I made sure to verify the commands and made sure that it was a successful 
installation on my local pc. I was able to work on spinning up a Kubuernetes cluster and in the process of it right now. I am almost 
done with getting the required installations and software that I need for the Cilium Project.


For next week, I will be looking to get started on working on some tasks from the team leads and working on getting some commits going. 
Additionally, going to research some topics that I am interested in such as some networking and working with Linux kernel. 
There were some errors in spinning up a cluster, so that will be the first thing I tackle next week.
