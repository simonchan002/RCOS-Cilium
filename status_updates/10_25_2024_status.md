This week, I was attempting to work on my azure login. I tried running az aks create --resource-group test-Cilium-rg --name test-Cilium-aks --node-count 1 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys command, however, I was running into alot of errors with it. There were errors creating the resource group and that was something I worked on for Tuesday. Additionally on Friday, after I did a git checkout for the latest updates in the azure mmigration branch, the terraform init command would get locked.

Next week, I plan to get my terraform init unlocked and for me to progress on the azure login. I plan on getting my terraform apply working again since it was working last week. For Azure , I want to reach out to get that fixed as well. I was thinking that I may not have the correct permissions on the azure account.

Terraform stack lock error when using terraform init. Meaning the admin must stop all the other processes and unlock it on their end.
